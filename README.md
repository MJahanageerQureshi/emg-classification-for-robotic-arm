# emg-classification-for-robotic-arm

This an implentaion of a neural network for simple non-linear classification. I plan to add more algorithms to the repository to hopefully create an ensemble of algorithms that have different learning techniques. Hopefully that should preform with more accuracy.
A collection of linear, tree, instance, neural network methods will be used

linear = logistic regression and linear discriminate analysis
tree =  CART, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
instance = SVM and kNN.
neural network =  ANN and CNN.
